Deep Town Game Player
A tool to help me optimize my placement of resources in Deep Town game.

The idea is to use a software to tell me when and where to place my resources so that I can gain the maximum amount of return.

Many solutions came to mind. Or at least feelings of having a solutions. Either deterministic or probabilistic. AI, neural network, brute force, deep learning, machine learning... The game is small and it's mechanics is fairly simple. It should have been a simple optimization problem when compared to a human life simulation, or at least I thought so...

Anyways, the program is running but generating a wrong output. The TODO list I have now are:
- link material consumption to item creation.
- implement a machine learning algorithm like cuckoo search

This program is written for fun. Trying to train my ability to identify and breakdown problems while also planning for its development at the same time.

Its educational and I'm open to discussions :D
Won't be very active as I have a day job though
